It may still be affected by surface water flooding, which this service does not cover. If you want to know if there’s surface water flooding (also known as ‘flash flooding’) in your area, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">contact your local council</a>.

          <li><a href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk" target="_blank">check the long term flood risk for an area in England</a>, including surface water</li>
          <li>continue to sign up for this area in case it becomes at risk in future</li>
